[MESSAGES CONTROL]

# Disable the message(s) with the given id(s).
#
# R0922: It warns about abstract class being only referenced once.
# E1101: For member function call detection, which causes false positives for
#        some reason.
# R0903: For too few public methods. This generates false positives in the case
#        of dummy classes.
# W0710: Complains about exceptions that don't derive from Exception. This
#        seems to cause false positives when there is indirect inheritance.
# I0011: Complains about inline suppressions.
# W0402: Generates false positves about string being deprecated. Some of string
#        is deprecated, but not the constants (ascii_letters).
# W0622: To support importing compatibility functions.
# bad-continuation: Checker is not very good. The pep8 tool works much better.
