Release R1-15l (2024-10-08 08:27:09):

	https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/11

Release R1-15k (2024-10-02 14:41:00):

	Updated GPU_MEM

Release R1-15j (2024-09-25 16:26:33):

	Let testing work when we can't import GpuMem (e.g. if we don't have
	cuda)

Release R1-15i (2024-09-17 15:49:08):

	Adding GPU memory to tests. See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/11.

Release R1-15h (2024-09-10 13:05:51):

	* Updating types in gpu_mem.cc
	* Bug fixes in locations we write GPU_MEM to.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/11

Release R1-15f (2024-09-09 11:38:49):

	https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-
	access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/11

Release R1-15e (2024-09-06 08:57:39):

	* Moving tags before RESOURCES.

Release R1-15a (2024-08-29 08:19:23):

	returning a false positive on a numpy false value. See also:

	https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/7

Release R1-15 (2024-08-17 08:41:59):

	* Now splitting with shlex and combinging args in sys.argv before
	parsing. Shlex is more robust and makes parsing args simpler. Combinging
	and parsing rather than parsing and combining means we don't have to try
	and sort out defaults before combining.

Release R1-14z (2024-08-13 12:34:20):

	* Calling logTee before we create the pool. We must modify values on
	Test before this happens, otherwise, it seems the workers don't pick the
	changes up.

Release R1-14y (2024-08-12 13:17:00):

	* Now using a shared variable to track GPU memory usage.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/9

	* Getting rid of quiet global variable. Cleaning up functions as a result.
	* Moving tests to Dtest args only.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/8

Release R1-14x (2024-08-10 13:38:59):

	* Bug fix. Should have been the intersection of two sets, not if both sets contain values.

Release R1-14w (2024-08-10 09:44:16):

	* Now processing extra arguments from SiteDefs that come through the Makefiles. This allows different exclude_tags, run_only_tags, and truth_suffix to each test.
	* Removing some global variables from Dtest that are now placed on args directly.
	* Fix the issue where tests were showing up relative to the sbox main directory rather than individual module directory.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/8

Release R1-14v (2024-08-09 09:44:27):

Release R1-14u (2024-08-09 06:37:00):

	* Adding dtest-sbox.
	* Major refactor of dtest.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/8

Release R1-14t (2024-07-29 10:46:15):

	comparison doesn't provide any info beyond whether running succeeded.
	Adds byte designation for python 3 in scripts/dtest-html.

Release R1-14s (2024-07-15 07:51:17):

	Adding CUI tag to test that require dlab3.

Release R1-14r (2024-07-01 11:32:57):

Release R1-14n (2024-04-25 15:49:39):

	* Adding convenience method for renaming orig files to fc38 and creating
	new orig files. This will be used for the port to FC40.

Release R1-14g (2024-03-29 11:30:12):

	* Adding the ability to specify GPU_MEM in the RESOURCES field of a DTESTDEFS.cfg file.
	* See https://dartsgitlab-internal.jpl.nasa.gov/darts-lab/jpl-internal/all-access/development/infrastructure/dtest/-/issues/6

Release R1-14e (2024-02-27 11:48:29):

	raises an expected error:

	>>> arr = [1, 2, 3]
	>>> with raises(IndexError):
	...     arr[5]

	See the docstring for more details.

Release R1-14c (2024-01-08 14:14:51):

Release R1-13u (2023-10-05 15:55:25):

	Last passed results only show for the same sandbox in emails.

Release R1-13c (2023-07-12 15:39:26):

	Made regtest HDF5 appends more robust.

Release R1-12x (2023-04-28 15:14:55):

	* Adding reg test for reg test webiste from Shay Ma's internship.

Release R1-12w (2023-02-23 07:09:17):

	* Adding missing return statement. Without this, the SERIAL tests get
	added to the serial and parallel groups and are run twice (once in
	serial and once in parallel).

Release R1-12v (2023-02-22 11:05:04):

	* Updating to include the logic for processing the SERIAL tag.

	Updated DCompareUtils.py to correctly compare nan values.

Release R1-11s (2020-01-30 17:18:30):

	Explictly runs tests in bash since test commands often assume bash. The
	old behavior was to use Python's default of sh. On fedora this is an
	alias to bash, so it still works, but other operating systems may break
	this assumption.

	Python3 compatability fixes

Release R1-11o (2019-12-02 12:38:35):

	lower/upper-case letters, digits, and underscores may be used.

	Cleaned up code for some code checking regtests.

Release R1-11l (2019-11-04 09:06:43):

	Slightly relaxed member function name requirement; allow underscores in the
	function name.  Generally, member functions should be camelcase with the first
	letter lower case.  But in some cases, an underscore near the end can be
	helpful.

Release R1-11h (2019-09-11 08:46:06):

	Fix to unit test code to deal with unit tests improperly failing.

Release R1-11f (2019-08-26 11:46:38):

	Added codechecking tag to test_dtest_kwstyle.

Release R1-11d (2019-05-14 16:55:02):

	Updated array comparison to ignore extra spaces. Fixed bug in which
	arrays were not compared correctly.

Release R1-11c (2019-03-25 10:06:11):

	Updated DUnitTest regtest evaluation code to be more robust to variation in
	spaces between sites.

Release R1-11b (2019-03-11 17:56:27):

	Fixed regtests, some code cleanup.

Release R1-10y (2018-07-02 18:21:46):

	Added support for comparision utilities to ignore filenames with a list of
	site- specific list of prefixes.  The SiteDefs site-specific environment
	variable DTEST_IGNORE_PATH_PREFIXES is queried to get a list path prefixes
	that should be ignored by dtest file comparision utilities.  If this site var
	is not defined, it defaults to '/home'.

Release R1-10w (2018-05-14 17:41:40):

	only affects running dtest in a Python3 sandbox.  The real issue still needs
	to be tracked down.

Release R1-10t (2018-04-20 14:03:28):

	Updated pylint test script to work on regtest server (dirac).

Release R1-10s (2018-04-19 16:08:21):

	Tags'.

Release R1-09m (2016-03-11 17:27:40):

	Fixed issue with CHILD_TAGS for dtest.

Release R1-09l (2016-03-11 15:37:37):

	Added support for CHILD_TAGS to allow child subdirectories to inherit a
	tag.

Release R1-09i (2015-12-15 09:30:26):

Release R1-09b (2015-12-09 12:03:29):

	Got dtest -c working again.

Release R1-09a (2015-12-08 17:13:15):

	Add regtest for giving DTEST additional truth suffixes via environment
	variables.

Release R1-09 (2015-12-08 16:33:09):

	Updated to support multiple truth suffixes.

Release R1-08w (2015-10-12 16:36:07):

	Added support for executing/excluding tests based on TAGS defined in the
	DTESTDEFS file in the same directory as the regtest.  From the sphinx
	docs, if you run dtest with the --exclude-tags option:

	      $ Drun dtest --exclude-tags logging

	then any regtest that defines TAGS to include 'logging' in its DTESTDEFS
	file will be excluded (skipped).

	You may also run only regtest that contain a specific tag:

	      $ <Drun> dtest --run-only-tags validation

	then only regtests that define TAGS to include 'validation' in its
	DTESTDEFS file will be executed.  Note that all regtests that are marked
	for skipping or quarantining, will not be run.

	Also, there are two special tags: 'skip' and 'quarantined'.  These do the
	same things as listing the regtests in parent DTESTDEFS file 'SKIP' or
	'QURANTINED' lists (respectivley).

	One advantage in using tagging to skip or quarantine a regtest is that
	skip/exclusion flag goes into the same directory as the regtest itself
	(not its parent).

Release R1-08v (2015-10-06 17:12:44):

	Added command line options for blacklist and exclude to dtest-kwstyle.

Release R1-08u (2015-09-23 11:02:30):

	Integrated DUnit, a testing framework derived from python's unittest. DUnit
	adds support for operations that we need such as comparing quaternions, etc.

Release R1-08i (2014-09-29 10:58:07):

	Support detecting comparison failure in unittest and doctest

Release R1-07z (2014-08-20 13:57:40):

	Updated sphinx docs.

Release R1-07u (2014-04-03 13:40:12):

	This is just a test of pyam's long message wrapping. Let us see if this
	works properly when used interactively.

Release R1-07t (2014-04-03 13:38:05):

	This is just a test of pyam's long message wrapping. Let us see if this
	works properly when used interactively.

	Move testing tool from pyam to here

Release R1-05u (2013-04-25 17:59:49):

	Add Python 3 support

Release R1-04y (2012-12-21 19:19:43):

	Highlight in red run-time errors in "failed tests" list

	This helps the user distinguish between comparison failures and run-time
	failures after running the tests in multiprocess mode.

Release R1-04r (2012-12-05 11:21:08):

	A couple of improvements to genRegtestMail and genRegtestHtml scripts from

Release R1-01w (2011-12-07 20:18:09):
	Fix the bug where no options are passed when run in parallel mode. This
	is accomplished by switching out the Make-based parallel processing with
	normal Python function calls (multiprocessing). This allows for running
	Python coverage in parallel. Also fix the problem where --dir doesn't

	'coveragepy' or 'memcheck' as argument.

Release R1-01e (Tue Aug  2 15:09:17 2011):
	Fixed issue with regupdate that it was ignoring emtpy files.

Release R1-01d (Tue Aug  2 14:22:16 2011):
